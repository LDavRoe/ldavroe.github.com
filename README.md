My Website
=========

This website is essentially my digital buisness card.

---

This README is primarily for attributions for resources that I did not create, such as icons:

- The github black octocat is from : 
[https://github.com/github/media/blob/master/octocats/blacktocat-32.png][] (2012-03-04)
- the linkedin icon is a rescaled from the 60px version found at : 
[http://developer.linkedin.com/documents/branding-guidelines#general-use][] (2012-03-04)
- The theme is a (very slightly) modified version of the minimalist theme: 
[https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal][] (2012-03-04)  
This theme files are:
    - stylesheets/pygment_trac.css
    - stylesheets/styles.css (slightly modified)
    - javascripts/scale.fix.js
    - params.json
    - images/arrow-down.png
    - images/octocat-small.png
    


Unless mentioned above I created the other stuff,

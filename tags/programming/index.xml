      <description>There are several ways to run small Kubernetes clusters: k3s and k3d, minikube, and microk8s to name a few. Currently, my favorite is the Kubernetes provided by Docker Desktop for Mac. But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t help my friends (or myself) when I am on a Linux laptop. It would be nice to have one lightweight and shared environment for Kubernetes.
Luckily, one of the Kubernetes groups has released KinD - Kubernetes in Docker.</description>

      <description>At work we have been expanding the testing coverage of our auth service and have discovered the perfect storm of edge cases around test caching and Go&amp;rsquo;s test building. In short, we had tests that looked like they were passing locally but would fail sporadically in CI because Go will run the tests inside of a package sequentially but build and test each package in parallel (up to the number of CPU cores).</description>

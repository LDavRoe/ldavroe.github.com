      <description>Last month, GitHub announced new improved CI/CD with GitHub Actions. Since then, I have experimented with the new Action workflows and created an Action that wraps the faas-cli so that you can easily build and deploy your functions directly from GitHub.
My initial interactions with the new GitHub Actions were not great, they really meant it when they said &amp;ldquo;public beta&amp;rdquo;. BUT!!! Having said that, there is clearly a lot of promise in GitHub Actions.</description>

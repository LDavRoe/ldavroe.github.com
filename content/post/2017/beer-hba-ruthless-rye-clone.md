This recipe is inspired by the [Seirra Nevada Ruthless Rye Clone](https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/homebrew-recipe/sierra-nevada-ruthless-rye-clone/) written up by the Home Brewers Association.  I have adjusted it to be a partial mash recipe with about 8 lbs of grains.


As the name suggests, this is a Rye based IPA that the HBA describes

>With a name like Ruthless Rye, you’re certainly in for something hearty and rustic. You’ll experience strong hop flavors due to dry hopping, which allows the aromatic oils and resins to be absorbed into the beer without an overpowering bitterness. When you add in rye’s spicy, black pepper flavor and dryness with the complex fruity, floral and herbal hop profile, you’ll end up with a balanced beer with incredible flavor, bringing the rye and hops to life finished with a ruthless, hoppy kiss.

## Me

I am director of engineering at [Teem.com](https://teem.com) and
an ex-mathematician. I have worked on web applications, algorithms for
image analysis, machine learning problems, and pure math research.

At the [University of Connecticut](http://www.math.uconn.edu) I
completed my Ph.D. studying combinatorics, tilting theory, and cluster
algebras with [Ralf Schiffler](http://www.math.uconn.edu/~schiffler).

You can find a brief guide to my research [here](/pdf/davroe_research_statement.pdf).
For all of the gory details, you can find all of my mathematical papers
on the [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+David_Roesler_L/0/1/0/all/0/1).
You can find some of my coding projects on [Github](https://github.com/LucasRoesler).

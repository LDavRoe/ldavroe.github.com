      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started this blog, I started with &lt;a href=&#34;//lucasroesler.com/2017/01/my-management-philosophy/&#34;&gt;My Management Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.  In short,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be a multiplier for your team and reduce friction&amp;hellip;
Successful managers make other people better at their jobs, “multiplying”
their productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wrote this, I was focusing on the ideas as a guide. &amp;ldquo;Should I do X?
Does it multiply my team&amp;rsquo;s effort?  Does it simplify their job?&amp;rdquo; Underlying
this is that good leadership requires &lt;em&gt;empathy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was having lunch with a friend when he asked what resources I
use to learn about management and tech leadership in general. I will share
some recommendations at the end, but my answer to him got me thinking about
my philosophy around management and how to be good at it, which is what I really
want to share here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: be a multiplier for your team and reduce friction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

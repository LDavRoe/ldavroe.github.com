I just finished my winter beer.  I usually do one dark spicy beer for the winter
season. Last year was the "Better Not Pout Stout", this year is the less
excitingly named "Spicy Winter Porter".

### The recipe
This is a partial mash recipe for a 5 gallon batch.

> Grains:
>
> - 5 lbs Pale Malt, Maris Otter
> - 1 lb Patagonia 190
> - 9 lbs 12 oz Pilsner Liquid Extract
>
> Hops:
>
> - 1 oz Chinook for 60 mins
> - 1 oz Goldings, East Kent for 30 mins
> - 1 oz Centennial for 15 mins
>
> Spices:
>
> - 1 oz coriander for 5 mins
> - 6 sticks cinnamon for 5 mins
>
> Yeast:
>
> - 2 pkg Safale American #US-05

At the end of the brew I recorded an original gravity of 1.068. I always use a
secondary fermentation, which I switched to after 14 days.  When I moved from
primary to secondary I recorded a gravity of 1.036.  I left it in secondary for
about 4 weeks.  Unfortunately, I didn't actually get any fermentation in
secondary. Come bottling day I had a final gravity of 1.036.

### The result
Drum roll please ... Today is the first tasting day and I am moderately happy
with this batch. I will definitely have to retry the recipe later this year.
This beer came out fairly sweet with a spicy flavor in the back of the mouth.
I was originally a little nervous about the cinnamon but it is not overly
powerful.  The coriander is subtle.

### Bottom line
Ultimately, I always look at my winter beers as a my big experiment and this
year was a mixed result.  I think it is probably sweater than I would like.
About a month ago I finished a red ale and I think I prefer that one over this
porter, but I wont be sad to drink it :)

### Update
Letting the beer bottle age another week made a _huge_ difference. The extra
sweetness went away and the extra carbonation made a big difference for the
mouth feel.  I am now willing to give this beer a hearty thumbs-up!  Just make
sure you let it fully age before you crack one open.
